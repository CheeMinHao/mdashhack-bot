Hey everyone!!! Before you start exploring the server, here are some things to take note of:

1. Please read the rules at #rules first before doing anything in the server. We practice strict adherence to the rules made for the server and would immediately take action should any breach of those rules are made

2. For Team Leaders, please indicate your team's desired topic at #select-topic for the team to know about the democraphics of the event.

3. If the team wishes to have a private group chat, the Team Leader must react to the message at #create-private-group-chat and a private room will be created for you. After that, you would need to manually add your team members into the group chat

4. For any questions about the event. Please do not hesitate to reach out to us via #qna. We will get back to you in around 1-2 days.
